=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>, when you want to ship a F<Build.PL> as well as a fallback
F<Makefile.PL> in case the user's cpan client is so old it doesn't recognize
C<configure_requires>:

    [MakeMaker::Fallback]
    [ModuleBuildTiny]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is a derivative of C<[MakeMaker]>, generating a F<Makefile.PL> in
your dist, with an added preamble that is printed when it is run:

=over 4

{{ $DATA }}

=back

Additionally, the C<build> and C<test> functionalities of the plugin
(C<< perl Makefile.PL && make >> and C<< make test >> respectively) are disabled.

It is a fatal error to use this plugin when there is not also another
C<InstallTool> plugin installed (for example, C<[ModuleBuildTiny]>, that must
not also generate a F<Makefile.PL>.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Peter Rabbitson (ribasushi), whose concerns that low-level utility modules
were shipping with install tools that did not work out of the box with perls
5.6 and 5.8 inspired the creation of this module.

Matt Trout (mst), for realizing a simple warning would be sufficient, rather
than a complicated detection heuristic, as well as the text of the warning

__DATA__
*** WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING ***

If you're seeing this warning, your toolchain is really, really old and you'll
almost certainly have problems installing CPAN modules from this century. But
never fear, dear user, for we have the technology to fix this!

If you're using CPAN.pm to install things, then you can upgrade it using:

    cpan CPAN

If you're using CPANPLUS to install things, then you can upgrade it using:

    cpanp CPANPLUS

If you're using cpanminus, you shouldn't be seeing this message in the first
place, so please file an issue on github.

If you're installing manually, please retrain your fingers to run Build.PL
when present instead.

This public service announcement was brought to you by the Perl Toolchain
Gang, the irc.perl.org #toolchain IRC channel, and the number 42.
